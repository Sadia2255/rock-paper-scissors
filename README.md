# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a website created using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It is fully
functional, and features a clean design that allows the user to play multiple 
games of rock, paper, scissors.

### Installing

To download the program, install all of the files in the repository.

### Executing program

To deploy as a web app, you can use a web service such as GitHub Pages,
which is what I have done. A link to the web service is on my GitHub
as well!
